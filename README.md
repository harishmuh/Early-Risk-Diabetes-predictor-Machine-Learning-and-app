# Early Risk Diabetes Predictor Machine Learning and App

## Context

What is Diabetes? Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. It occurs when your blood glucose, also known as blood sugar, is too high. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. Each type affects the body in different ways, but they all involve problems with insulin production or use. Diabetes is one of the most important diseases Global Impact: Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that about 422 million people have diabetes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Health Risks: If not managed properly, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputation. Rising Numbers: The prevalence of diabetes is steadily increasing, making early detection and management crucial.

## Problem Statement

Why an Early Diabetes Predictor App? Early detection of diabetes can significantly improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of severe complications. Traditional methods for diagnosing diabetes often involve lab tests, which can be expensive and inconvenient. An app that predicts the risk of diabetes based on readily available symptoms can serve as an initial screening tool, providing an early warning and encouraging people to seek medical advice promptly.

## Conclusion
 we selected the tuned Random Forest as the best model due to its balanced performance without significantly compromising other parameters. The model has high recall score on the test data by 98.9% with relatively smaller False Negative and Small False Positive.

 ## Insights
* Model Performance: The Random Forest model provided a reliable and balanced performance, making it a suitable choice for deployment.
* Feature Importance: Symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia, are strong indicators of diabetes risk according to model.

## Recommendations
* Health Monitoring: Incorporate regular health check-ups and symptom tracking to identify potential risks early.
* Further Research: Explore additional data sources and refine models to enhance prediction accuracy.
* User Education: Educate users about the importance of early detection and the symptoms of diabetes.
